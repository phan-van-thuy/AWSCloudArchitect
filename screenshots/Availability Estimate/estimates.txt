Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: 
- Within minutes, due to seamless failover to a standby replica in another Availability Zone, ensuring minimal downtime.
Minimum RTO for a single region outage: 
- In the order of tens of minutes, as the failover process involves coordination across multiple AZs and potentially across regions.
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage:
- Usually measured in seconds, reflecting low-latency replication mechanisms synchronizing data between Availability Zones.
Minimum RPO for a single region outage: 
- Ranges from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on the efficiency of cross-region replication processes, but generally kept as low as possible to minimize data loss in the event of a catastrophic failure.
